# Random Password Generator

This project contains two implementations of a random password generator:

1.  A Flutter application (`password_generator_app/`)
2.  A simple web version (`src/`)

## Flutter Application

The Flutter application is a cross-platform app that allows you to generate random passwords with customizable options.

### Installation and Running

To run the Flutter application, you need to have the Flutter SDK installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ItIsCiprian/Random-Password-Generator.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Flutter app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Random-Password-Generator/password_generator_app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash

    ```
    This will run the app on any connected device (Android, iOS, etc.) or emulator.
